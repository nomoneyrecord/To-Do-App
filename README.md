## Summary 

This was the first app that I really started to grasp a lot of the functionality of Javascript. Lots of trial and error, but discovered many moments where I was able to call a command and it made sense to why I would utilize that method. This took me about a week to work through, but I learned about dynamically creating HTML elements through Javascript. Also, getting more comfortable with the DOM and formulating effective builds with these 3 languages. Very excited with building my knowledge base and being more effective at problem solving. Had fun with this project.
